Thank you for picking up this collection of Sketched Books! I share
these sketches for free under the Creative Commons Attribution license
because I want to help more people learn about, remember, and share
the good ideas in books. If you'd like to show your appreciation, you
can buy this on a pay-what-you-want basis from
http://sketchedbooks.com/collection. You can get e-mail notifications
of updates from there, too.

I'd love to hear from you! You can contact me at
